# Yappa Mailcatcher Docker Image

This adds mailcatcher and makes it available on on port 1080.

## Usage

Add the following to your docker-compose.yml file:

```YAML
mailcatcher:
    image: yappabe/mailcatcher
    ports:
        - 1025:1025
        - 1080:1080
```
Next, add this container to your php container's links.

You can now use mailcatcher as an smtp server, simply use 'mailcatcher', or whatever you named this container as host on port 1025.
